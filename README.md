cudatest:
Explored some basic features of parallelism by using CUDA on Visual Studio 2015 on windows 10. 

Finished:

  -Parallelized string parse
  
   -Implementation of computation
  
  -Getting data from the Internet according to user's request 
  
  -URL analysis(easy, plug in parameters)
    
  -How to build socket, data stream, etc. preferably by BOOST
    
  -User customization of computation
  
  -Parallelism of complicated indices like EMA
  
  -Graphic interface
  
  
To be done:

  -Efficieny test
